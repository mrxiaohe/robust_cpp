robust_cpp
==========

The functions in `robustmethods_CPP.R` are adapted from a subset of robust statistical methods written by [Dr. Rand Wilcox](http://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/rwilcox/software/). It contains functions that call the relevant C++ sub-routines, which provide substantial speed increases compared to the original functions that are entirely in R
