robust_cpp
==========

This set of functions contains several Robust statistical methods that are partially implemented in C++ by using the `RcppArmadillo` and `Rcpp` packages. These robust methods are originally written by Dr. Rand Wilcox ([R-Forge link](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/wrs/)). The native R codes of these functions are rather slow. The partial C++ implementations provide substantial speed increases.
